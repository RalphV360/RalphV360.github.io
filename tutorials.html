          />
          <br />
          <br />
          <h5><b>APERTURE</b></h5>
          <p>
            <b>APERTURE:</b> The higher the aperture, the more background will
            be visible. If the aperture is lower, the background will be
            blurred. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>
              *Keep in mind that the lower the aperture, the more expensive the
              lens will be.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h5><b>SHUTTER SPEED</b></h5>
          <p>
            <b>SHUTTER SPEED:</b> A fast shutter speed means that less light is
            entering your camera, while a slow shutter speed means that more
            light is entering your camera. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>
              *A fast shutter speed is recommended for morning photoshoots,
              while a slow shutter speed is recommended for night photoshoots.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h5><b>ISO</b></h5>
          <p>
            <b>ISO:</b> ISO in a camera refers to the sensitivity of the
            camera's image sensor to light. It is an important camera setting
            that determines how much light is needed to produce a properly
            exposed photo. A higher ISO setting makes the camera's sensor more
            sensitive to light, allowing for photos to be taken in low-light
            conditions without the need for a slower shutter speed or wider
            aperture. However, increasing the ISO also increases the amount of
            digital noise in the image, which can result in a loss of detail and
            image quality. Therefore, photographers typically choose an ISO
            setting that balances the need for a well-exposed image with the
            desire for high-quality results. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>
              *I highly recommend to keep your ISO low to avoid grainy pictures.
            </strong>

          <h4 id="top"><strong>TYPES OF PHOTOGRAPHY</strong></h4>
          <h5><b>1. PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHY</b></h5>
          <p>
            One of the most common photography styles, portrait photography, or
            portraiture, aims to capture the personality and mood of an
            individual or group. <br />
            <br />
            Images may be candid or posed, full body or close-ups. Either way,
            the subject’s face and eyes are typically in focus. Lighting and
            backdrop help to convey tone and emotion. <br />
            <br />
            Popular types of photography portraits include senior portraits,
            family portraits, engagement photos, and professional headshots.
            <br />
            <br />
            The best portrait photographers make clients feel completely
            comfortable, so that their expressions are natural and relaxed.

            height="500"
          />
          <hr />
          <h5><b>2. PHOTOJOURNALISM</b></h5>
          <p>
            Photojournalism is a way of telling the story of a newsworthy
            (perhaps even historic) event or scene through photographs. <br />
            <br />
            Photojournalism should be as objective and truthful as possible and
            capturing candid moments as they happen is more important than
            getting picture-perfect shots. <br />
            <br />
            Generally, photojournalists attend planned events with the hope of
            capturing unplanned, unscripted moments. Their work is routinely
            published in magazines and newspapers.
          </p>
          <img

            width="auto"
            height="500"
          />
          <hr />
          <h5><b>3. SPORTS PHOTOGRAPHY</b></h5>
          <p>
            By catching athletes, coaches, and even fans at the perfect moment,
            sports photographs can depict the passion, drama, and emotion that
            fuels sporting events. <br />
            <br />
            Sports photographers must aim and shoot quickly to keep up with the
            action around them, and it’s best practice to use a higher ISO to
            shoot at a faster shutter speed. <br />
            <br />
            Sports photographers also usually use long, heavy lenses for zooming
            in on the action. Interesting angles can help make your work stand
            out in this competitive genre.
          </p>

          <hr />
          <h5><b>4. ARCHITECTURAL PHOTOGRAPHY</b></h5>
          <p>
            Both the interior and exterior design of buildings and structures
            are the subject of architectural photography. <br />
            <br />
            From warehouses to city bridges to old country barns, this genre
            encompasses diverse structures. Often, the photograph showcases the
            structure’s most aesthetically pleasing parts, such as a particular
            beam or archway. <br />
            <br />
            Interesting materials and colors may also be emphasized. <br />
            <br />
            Lighting can be challenging in architectural photography and, for
            exteriors, photographers must know how to work with natural light.
            <br />
            <br />
            Gear such as a tilt-shift lens, a tripod, and a panorama head is
            often useful. Architectural photographs can be of value to
            designers, architects, leasing companies, and building investors.

            <strong>TIPS AND TRICKS FOR BEGINNERS</strong>
          </h4>
          <h5><b>1. LEARN THE BASICS</b></h5>
          <p>
            It's important to understand the basics of photography, such as
            aperture, shutter speed, ISO, composition, and lighting. There are
            plenty of resources online, such as tutorials, books, and courses
            that can help you learn these fundamental concepts.
          </p>
          <h5><b>2. EXPERIMENT</b></h5>
          <p>
            Don't be afraid to experiment with your camera settings, angles, and
            composition. This is how you can discover your personal style and
            develop your own creative vision.
          </p>
          <h5><b>3. PRACTICE REGULARLY</b></h5>
          <p>
            The more you practice, the better you'll get. Take your camera with
            you wherever you go and try to capture interesting subjects and
            compositions. Regular practice will help you hone your skills and
            develop your own unique style.
          </p>
          <h5><b>4. LEARN FROM OTHERS</b></h5>
          <p>
            Look at the work of other photographers for inspiration and ideas.
            Analyze their techniques and compositions to gain insight into how
            they create their images.
          </p>
          <h5><b>5. DON'T RELY ON GEAR</b></h5>
          <p>
            While having good equipment can certainly help, it's important to
            remember that the best camera won't make up for poor technique or
            composition. Focus on developing your skills first and then invest
            in gear that will help you achieve your goals.
          </p>
          <h5><b>6. KEEP IT SIMPLER</b></h5>
          <p>
            In the beginning, it's easy to get overwhelmed by all the different
            settings and options on your camera. Start by keeping it simple and
            focusing on one or two settings at a time. This will help you
            develop a deeper understanding of each setting and how it affects
            your photos.
          </p>
          <h5><b>7. HAVE FUN</b></h5>
          <p>
            Photography is a fun and rewarding hobby, so don't forget to enjoy
            the process! Experiment, try new things, and don't be afraid to make
            mistakes. The more you enjoy the process, the more likely you are to
            stick with it and improve over time.
